## Six Faithful Serving Men

### What

Exercises in APL in the [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) style.

### Who

The Exercism project provides generic (or canonical) exercise specifications from which programming language specific exercises are derived.
These specifications are suitable for automatic generation of test cases.

AtelesPaniscus has written such an exercise generator program (EGP) and reference solutions for many exercises.

### How

The Exercism [Problem Specifications](http://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications) repository provides the source files for the EGP.

The Exercism source directory is expected to provide three files:

  * canonical-data.json
  * description.md
  * metadata.yml

The EGP produces four files:

  * README.md
  * slug-name.tc
  * slug-name.apl
  * slug-name-example.apl

The EGP is of my own, not the Exercism project's, devising.
It is written in Python 3.
It evolves rapidly but will eventually be published here.

### Why

Naturally there is more than one reason behind this repository/project:

  * I wanted to practise APL but the Exercism track had only 7 exercises.
  * I thought building an exercise generator program would be fun.
  * My code is not up to the very high standards required by the Exercism project.
  * Longer term I will need non-trivial APL test cases for another project.

This last is likely to be the final, but not the only reason,
for dropping compatibility with the Exercism GNU APL track at some point in the unforeseeable future.

## The Files that Comprise an Exercise

### The README.md File

This is a verbatim copy of `description.md` with an extra paragraph that acknowledges the exercise's source.
This paragraph is a short sentence derived from the contents of `metadata.yml`.

This file is produced by the EGP program but
invariably the sentence derived from the contents of `metadata.yml` is modified by hand so that it scans properly.

### The slug-name.tc File

This is the file containing test cases.
It is generated by the EGP from the `canonical-data.json` file.

Generally, if the EGP does not produce what is required, it is modified to do so:
only one or two test case files have been modified by hand.

The test case files are not stand alone but require the Exercism GNU APL test harness to run.
This maintains some measure of compatibility.

### The slug-name.apl

This provides students with a place to start - essentially an empty solution.

The rational behind this is that otherwise the first thing the student must do is look at the test cases
in order to find out the name(s) of the function(s) they are expected to write.
It is our belief that students should only examine the test cases as a last resort.

### The slug-name-example.apl

The Exercism project requires each exercise be accompanied by a reference solution.
The Exercism guide to implementing an exercise from specification states:

> The solution does not need to be particularly great code, it is only used to verify that the exercise is coherent.

I need to implement reference solutions to indirectly test the EGP.

The reference solutions are the (first pass) solutions that I would have submitted to Exercism were the exercises available there.

I do not claim my code is great code:  my code is fun code.
Show me your code and I will learn from it:
do not waste your time trying to telling me what I may already know.

If you too want to practice writing APL, then ignore my reference solution until you have a working solution of your own.

## Use and Abuse of Substance

### EGP Extension Policy

It is viewed as inevitable that hand correction of the EGP output will be needed for some exercises.
Adapting the EGP to handle lots of unique special cases would very likely be more trouble than it is worth.

If a special case appears to be another example of a special case already dealt with by hand,
then a general solution that can be implemented in the EGP will be sought.

If the special case appears to represent a small lacuna in the EGP that can be fixed by extension of the code within the current design,
then the extension will be implemented.

If the special case appears to be a regression then the EGP will be corrected.

### Running the Tests Cases for Yourself

Ah ... in short, you are on your own.

For now, this repository is just that.  Someday I will need to describe how to set up to run the first exercise.
At the moment that means getting a copy of the Exercism GNU APL test harness.  Enjoy.

The test harness is SEP: do not direct any criticism of it towards me.

To run the test cases for an exercise, I `cd` into the slug-named directory for the exercise and enter:

```bash
    apl --emacs -s -T *.tc
```

When I am very lucky I get the report:

```code
    0 errors in 1(1) testcase files
```

When I am not, I get anything between a report that more tests have failed than there are cases to fail
to an infinite loop as the GNU APL interpreter juggles exceptions deep within its bowels.

I find this last behaviour obliges me to kill the APL interpreter from another command line.

I think this is retribution on the part of GNL APL for breaking the Exercism commandment
"Thou shall not use lambda functions".
There are several cases in GNU APL of the interpreter behaving in a sane manner when used interactively
but not so when using the GNU APL test harness.  This is one of them.

There is little Exercism or I can do about these but they may eventually push me to abandon them
GNU APL test harness and so compatibility with the Exercism track.


## Week 1

The task for the first week was to build an EGP to regenerate the seven exercises that had previously been built by hand by the GNU APL track team.
This was done because these are the only exercises for which there is a reference
against which the output of the EGP may be compared.

The seven exercises were:

  * hello-world
  * leap
  * hamming
  * rna-transcription
  * raindrops
  * difference-of-squares
  * pangram

These are simple exercises that provide good examples of the `canonical-data.json` input the EGP needs to handle
(in particular the 'nesting' of 'cases').

It was felt necessary to introduce flags for the EGP to control the output and/or provide information missing from `canonical-data.json` or
override the information present.

First, some exercises have bad test cases.
What error should the EGP expect ?
In the seven exercises, 'hamming' is expected to generate LENGTH ERROR and in 'rna-transcription' DOMAIN ERROR.
The '`-e`' flag was added to tell the EGP which error to expect (and provide the means).

Second, the '`-n`' (for parameter name) was added.
For dyadic functions ('hamming'), this flag may be used to ensure the parameters are the way round humans might expect them to be.
For monadic functions ('leap'), this flag may be used to override the some times lame parameter name used in the `canonical-data.json` file.

Third the '`-t`' (for types) was added to indicate the type of function parameters and their results.
The EGP needs to enclose strings and characters in apostrophes and to use 0 and 1, not False and True, for Booleans.
It may be possible for the EGP to deduce the types correctly most of the time
so this flag was first introduced to handle cases where the deduction was incorrect or inappropriate.
However, always specifying the types explicitly is more consistent so the flag quickly became expected.
