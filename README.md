## Six Faithful Serving Men

### What

Exercises in APL in the [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) style.

### Who

The Exercism project provides generic (or canonical) exercise specifications from which programming language specific exercises are derived.
These specifications are suitable for automatic generation of test cases.

AtelesPaniscus has written such an exercise generator program and reference solutions for many exercises.

### How

The Exercism [Problem Specifications](http://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications) repository provides the source files
for the exercise generator program.

The Exercism source directory is expected to provide three files:

    * canonical-data.json
    * description.md
    * metadata.yml

The exercise generator program produces four files:

    * README.md
    * slug-name.tc
    * slug-name.apl
    * slug-name-example.apl

The exercise generator program is of my own, not the Exercism project's, devising.
It is written in Python 3.
It evolves rapidly but will eventually be published here.

### Why

Naturally there is more than one reason behind this repository/project:

  * I wanted to practice APL but the Exercism track had only 7 exercises.
  * I thought building an exercise generator program would be fun.
  * My code is not up to the very high standards required by the Exercism project.
  * Longer term I will need non-trivial APL test cases for another project.

This last will almost certainly mean dropping compatibility with the Exercism GNU APL track at some point in the unforeseeable future.

### Where

On [GitHub](https://github.com/AtelesPaniscus/apl-exorcism).

### When

2018 CE.

## More on the Files that Comprise an Exercise

### The README.md File

This is a verbatim copy of `description.md` with an extra paragraph that acknowledges the exercise's source.
This paragraph is a short sentence derived from the contents of `metadata.yml`.

This file is produced by the exercise generator program but
invariably the sentence derived from the contents of `metadata.yml`
is modified by hand so that it scans properly.

### The slug-name.tc File

This is the file containing test cases.
It is generated by the exercise generator program from the `canonical-data.json` file.

If the program does not produce what is required, it is modified to do so:
only one or two test cases files have been modified by hand.

The test case files are not stand alone but require the Exorcism GNU APL test harness to run.
This maintains some measure of compatibility.

### The slug-name.apl

This provides students with a place to start - essentially an empty solution.

The rational behind this is that otherwise the first thing the student must do is look at the test cases
in order to find out the name(s) of the function(s) they are expected to write.
It is our belief that students should only examine the test cases as a last resort.

### The slug-name-example.apl

The Exercism project requires each exercise be accompanied by a reference solution.
The Exercism guide to implementing an exercise from specification states:

> The solution does not need to be particularly great code, it is only used to verify that the exercise is coherent.

I needed to implement reference solutions to indirectly test the exercise generator program.

The reference solutions are the (first pass) solutions that I would have submitted to Exercism where the exercises available there.

I do not claim my code is great code:  my code is fun code.
Do not waste your time trying to telling me what I may already know.
Show me your code and I will learn from it.

If you too want to practice writing APL, then ignore my reference solution until you have a working solution of your own.

### Running the Tests Cases for Yourself

Ah ... in short, you are on your own.

For now, this repository is just that.  Someday I will need to describe how to set up to run the first exercise.
At the moment that means getting a copy of the Exercism GNU APL test harness.  Enjoy.
The test harness is SEP: do not direct any criticism of it towards me.

To run the test cases for an exercise, I `cd` into the slug-named directory for the exercise and enter:

```bash
    apl --emacs -s -T *.tc
```

When I am very lucky I get the report:

```code
    0 errors in 1(1) testcase files
```

When I am not, I get anything between a report that more tests have failed than there are cases to fail
to an infinite loop as the GNU APL interpreter juggles exceptions deep within its bowels.

I find this last behaviour obliges me to kill the process from another command line.
