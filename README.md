<!-- apl-exalt by NewForester:  Exercism-style exercises in APL and a test case generator in Python 3 -->

## Six Faithful Serving Men

### What

Exercises in APL in the [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) style.

This project and its notes assume you are familiar with Exercism, Exercism tracks
and devising solutions to 'slugs' (aka exercises).

Familiarity with contributing 'slugs' is not required but may help.

### Who

The Exercism project provides generic (or canonical) exercise specifications from which programming language specific exercises are derived.
These specifications are suitable for automatic generation of test cases.

AtelesPaniscus has written such an exercise generator program (EGP).
He has also implemented reference solutions for many exercises.

### How

The Exercism [Problem Specifications](http://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications) repository provides the source files for the EGP.

The Exercism source directory is expected to provide three files:

  * canonical-data.json
  * description.md
  * metadata.yml

The EGP produces four files:

  * README.md
  * slug-name.tc
  * slug-name.apl
  * slug-name-example.apl

The EGP is of my own, not the Exercism project's, devising.
It is written in Python 3.
It evolves rapidly but will eventually be published here.

### Why

Naturally there is more than one reason behind this repository/project:

  * I wanted to practise APL but the Exercism track had only 7 exercises.
  * I thought building an exercise generator program would be fun.
  * My APL code is not up to the very high standards required by the Exercism project.
  * Longer term I will need non-trivial APL test cases for another project.

This last is likely to be the final, but not the only reason,
for dropping compatibility with the Exercism GNU APL track at some point in the unforeseeable future.

### Where

On [GitHub](https://github.com/AtelesPaniscus/apl-exalt).

### When

2018 CE.


## The Files that Comprise an Exercise

### The README.md File

This is a verbatim copy of `description.md` with an extra paragraph that acknowledges the exercise's source.
This paragraph is a short sentence derived from the contents of `metadata.yml`.

This file is produced by the EGP program but
invariably the sentence derived from the contents of `metadata.yml` is modified by hand so that it scans properly.

### The slug-name.tc File

This is the file containing test cases.
It is generated by the EGP from the `canonical-data.json` file.

Generally, if the EGP does not produce what is required, it is modified to do so:
only one or two test case files have been modified by hand.

The test case files are not stand alone but require the Exercism GNU APL test harness to run.
This maintains some measure of compatibility with the Exercism GNU APL track.

### The slug-name.apl

This provides students with a place to start - essentially an empty solution.

The rational behind this is that otherwise the first thing the student must do is look at the test cases
in order to find out the name(s) of the function(s) they are expected to write.
It is our opinion students should only examine the test cases as a last resort.

### The slug-name-example.apl

The Exercism project requires each exercise be accompanied by a reference solution.
The Exercism guide to implementing an exercise from specification states:

> The solution does not need to be particularly great code, it is only used to verify that the exercise is coherent.

I need to implement reference solutions to indirectly test the EGP.

The reference solutions are the (first pass) solutions that I would have submitted to Exercism were the exercises available there.

I do not claim my code is great code:  my code is fun code.
Show me your code and I will learn from it:
do not waste your time trying to tell me what I may already know.

If you too want to practice writing APL, then ignore my reference solution until you have a working solution of your own.

## Use and Abuse of Substance

### EGP Extension Policy

It is viewed as inevitable that hand correction of the EGP output will be needed for some exercises.
Adapting the EGP to handle lots of unique special cases would very likely be more trouble than it is worth.

If a special case appears to be another example of a special case already dealt with by hand,
then a general solution that can be implemented in the EGP will be sought.

If the special case appears to represent a small lacuna in the EGP that can be fixed by extension of the code within the current design,
then the extension will be implemented.

If the special case appears to be a regression then the EGP will be corrected.
